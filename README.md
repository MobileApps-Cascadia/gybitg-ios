Get Your Butt in the Gym is an app that supports female basketball players in their junior and senior years of high school. It allows the girls to showcase their athletic skills, as well as develop and track essential basketball skills that college coaches are looking for in a new recruit.

Some of the current features include recording and save a video, creating an account, and adding a new game stat entry.

Record and Save a Video - The user is able to either take a video and it will be saved to their video library or select an existing video from their library. A thumbnail of the videos will be created and added to the gallery tableview.

Account Creation - The user can begin creating an account by filling out the New Account form. Supported input parameters include Email, Password, First and Last name, High School Name, Club Team/AAU Team, Graduation Year, and State. These fields are verified when submitted.

Game Stat Entry - The user is able to view all their stats, save and edit a stat entry with the properties: game date, points, rebounds, assists, steals, blocks, minutes played, opposing team name, and home/away game.
